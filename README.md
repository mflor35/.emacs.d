# .emacs.d

This is a back up of my Emacs configuration. Anyone is more than welcome to copy and use it, but you might run into issues as it is not as easy as just cloning this repo.

However if you look at [init.el](https://github.com/mflor35/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el) you can copy from [line 23](https://github.com/mflor35/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el#L23) to [line 163](https://github.com/mflor35/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el#L163)
to your own ```~/.emacs.d/init.el``` file without any issues. The rest of the configuration is specific to certain packages which might not allow emacs to load properly.

working on cleaning things up a bit...
